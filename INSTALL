Installation instructions for format checkers (optional).

The format checkers help you validate the file formats of your input and
output files.
The format checkers are written in Go, but your programs can be written in any
language.

To install the format checkers, first make sure you have Go installed.

===== To install Go =====

If you have Go installed, you can skip this section.

Download Go here: http://golang.org/doc/install
Follow the instructions to install Go.
Be sure to correctly set the environment variables.

$GOROOT should point to the installation directory (e.g., "/usr/local/go", or
"c:\Go" on Windows).

$GOPATH should point to a directory you have write access (e.g., "${HOME}/.go"
or "${HOME}/Go", create this directory if needed).

$GOBIN should point to "${GOPATH}/bin". Binaries (executables) are installed
there.

Add $GOBIN to your ${PATH}, e.g., by the command
  $ export PATH=${PATH}:${GOBIN}

===== To install the format checkers =====

Make sure you have correctly set the environment variables (see above).

Copy this directory (mlst) into the directory "${GOPATH}/src" (create this
directory if needed), so that e.g., this file is located at
"${GOPATH}/src/mlst/INSTALL".

Run the following command:
  $ go install mlst/check_input mlst/check_output

===== To use the format checkers =====

To check the input file, run:
  $ check_input
or
  $ check_input file.in

The first command checks the default input file (i.e., "mlst.in"), and the
second command checks the input file "file.in".

To check the output file, run:
  $ check_output
or
  $ check_output file.in file.out

The first command checks the default output file (i.e., "mlst.out") against
the default input file (i.e., "mlst.in").
The second command checks the output file "file.out" against the input file
"file.in".

===== To hack the format checkers =====

If you have modified the format checkers (e.g., by changing "config.go"), you
can recompile and update your binaries by rerunning the installation command:
  $ go install mlst/check_input mlst/check_output

After that, $ check_input and $ check_output will call the new binaries.

For an introduction to Go, see: http://tour.golang.org/

If you want to write some Go programs to reuse our codes, add a new directory
under mlst (see "mlst/check_input" and "mlst/check_output" for examples).
To compile and install a new command whose source file is under, e.g.,
"mlst/solve", run:
  $ go install mlst/solve

To run the new command:
  $ solve

===== To uninstall the format checkers =====

Run the following command:
  $ go clean -i mlst/check_input mlst/check_output mlst
